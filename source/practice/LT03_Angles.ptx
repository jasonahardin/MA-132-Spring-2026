      <p>
        Draw an example of each of the following and label them as necessary. If it is not possible to draw something, explain why.
      </p>
    </introduction>

    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A right angle
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Answers will vary. A right angle is one which measures exactly <m>90^\circ</m> (a quarter of a complete rotation).

        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Answers will vary. Any two complementary angles (sum of measures is <m>90^\circ</m>) will work.

          A pair of complementary angles that are not adjacent.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Answers will vary. Any two angles which do not share a common side but whose measures add to <m>90^\circ</m> will work.

    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A pair of adjacent angles that are not supplementary angles.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Answers will vary. Any two angles which share a side and have measures adding to something other than <m>180^\circ</m> will work.

    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Two angles that are congruent but not adjacent.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>

        Suppose someone designs an 18-hour clock in a similar fashion to the usual 12-hour clock; 
        namely, the numbers 1 through 18 are equally-spaced going clockwise with 9 at the bottom (where the 6 usually is) 
        and 18 at the top (where 12 usually is). How many degrees does the hour hand move each hour? Each minute?
