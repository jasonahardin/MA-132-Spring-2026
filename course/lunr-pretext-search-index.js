If is cm long, how long is ?      Henry bought liter of fruit juice. He kept liter of it in a bottle and poured the remainder equally into cups. How much fruit juice was there in each cup? Give your final answer in liters; it should be a fraction.      The length of three rods are in the ratio . If the total length is cm, find the length of the largest rod.      After cutting off a length of m from a rope m long, the remainder is divided into equal pieces. What is the length of each piece? Give your answer in meters; final answer should be a decimal.
